# Metabolomic Data Analysis App

An interactive Dash application for visualizing and analyzing differential metabolites and pathways across single- and multi-study datasets. By leveraging harmonized metabolite annotations, the app enables you to:

- Explore metabolic data from individual studies
- Integrate large-scale public repositories (e.g., MetaboLights, MetabolomicsWorkbench) or your own data (using RefMet or ChEBI IDs)
- Uncover multi-study signatures and trends
- Maximize reusability and reproducibility of metabolomics data

With a focus on standardization and integration, this tool supports scientific discovery through comprehensive, accessible data visualization and analysis.

## Features

1. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   - Dynamic plots of differential metabolites, differential pathways, clustering, and more.  

2. **Single-Study Analysis**  
   - Upload your own processed data (RefMet/ChEBI IDs).  
   - Filter, sort, and visualize metabolites and pathways from a single experiment.

3. **Multi-Study Analysis**  
   - Integrate data from multiple sources (e.g., public repositories or your own studies).  
   - Harmonize metabolite annotations across studies to find common signatures.  
   - Compare study-specific vs. cross-study trends in a unified view.

4. **Public Repository Integration**  
   - Pull annotated metabolomic data directly from MetaboLights or MetabolomicsWorkbench.  
   - Harmonize annotations using RefMet or ChEBI IDs under the hood.

5. **Reproducibility and Reusability**  
   - Built-in support for standardized formats and nomenclature.  
   - Easy export of (high resolution) plots, tables, and filtered datasets for downstream analysis or publication.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EloisaRL/Metabolomic-data-analysis-app.git
cd metabolight-data-analysis-app
```

### Set up the Environment
Ensure you are using **Python 3.12.9** (or create a virtual environment with it).    

**Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
```
### Install Dependencies
Install all required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the App 

```bash
python index.py
```
You’ll see output similar to:

```console
Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/  (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
**Ctrl+Click** (or **Cmd+Click** on macOS) the link to open the app in your browser.

## Usage

The app allows users to perform two types of analysis: single-study analysis and multi-study analysis. Both types of analysis perform differential testing to identify either differential metabolites or differential pathways, but they differ in the way these results are visualised.

### Single-Study Analysis

Single-study analysis produces a box plot of the top 10 metabolites/pathways (the number of metabolites/pathways visualised can be determined by the user) and a csv table with the all the differential metabolites/pathways for the selected study.

#### Differential metabolites tab
![Differential-metabolites-tab-ssa-page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b208f0e-ec04-4007-b4c9-2c640aa35198)

#### Differential pathways tab
![Differential-pathways-tab-ssa-page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/493cc472-b44d-409e-8221-e4dd288f1e1a)


### Multi-Study Analysis

Multi-study analysis produces upset plots of the co-occuring metabolites and differential metabolites (metabolites are matched based on the metabolite name, **not** the ChEBI id) for the selected studies. Also, cytoscape-based network graphs are produced as either differential metabolites (metabolites are matched based on the metabolite name) or differential pathways as the nodes, for the selected studies.

## Example Data (“Dummy Project”)

To help you get started, we’ve included a **Dummy_project** folder containing preprocessed files originating from MetaboLights and Metabolomics Workbench studies:

```bash
/Dummy_project
├── /Processed-datasets
    ├── processed_MTBLS1866_knn_imputer_log_transform_standard_scaler.csv
    ├── processed_MTBLS2014_knn_imputer_log_transform_standard_scaler.csv
    ├── processed_ST000041_knn_imputer_log_transform_standard_scaler.csv
    └── ...
├── project_details_file.json
└── /Plots

### 1. Processed Datasets

- **Filename convention**:  
  `processed_<STUDY_ID>_<preprocessing_steps>.csv`  
  e.g. `processed_MTBLS1866_knn_imputer_log_transform_standard_scaler.csv`
- **Metabolite columns headers**:  
  - For MetaboLights studies (e.g. `MTBLS1866`), column headers are **ChEBI IDs**.  
  - For Metabolomics Workbench studies (e.g. `ST000041`), column headers are **RefMet names**.
  - For your own studies uploaded with ChEBI ids or RefMet names the column headers will not change.
- **Usage**:  
  - Processed datasets are in saved in the conventional format as those accepted by MetaboAnalyst (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/home.xhtml). However, when you load these CSVs into MetaboAnalyst, those same IDs/names will appear on all plots and tables.

### 2. Project Details (`project_details_file.json`)

This JSON file contains, for each study:

| Field                  | Description                                                                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `filename`             | Name of the processed CSV in `Processed-datasets/` (e.g. `processed_MTBLS1866_knn_imputer_….csv`).        |
| `study_id`             | The original study identifier (e.g. `MTBLS1866`, `ST000041`).                                             |
| `group_type`           | Metadata field used for grouping (e.g. `Factor Value[Medical case]`).                                     |
| `preprocessing`        | Ordered list of preprocessing steps applied (e.g. `["knn_imputer", "log_transform", "standard_scaler"]`). |
| `outliers`             | Sample ID(s) flagged as outliers (e.g. `"SA 8"` or `["SA 3","SA 8"]`).                                    |
| `group_filter`         | Maps “Control” and “Case” labels to the raw metadata values:                                              |
| `Control`              | List of values interpreted as the control group (e.g. ["HEALTHY"]).                                       |
| `Case`                 | List of values interpreted as the case group (e.g. ["COVID-19"]).                                         |

> **Note on metadata conventions**  
> - **MetaboLights** uses metadata columns prefixed with `Factor_Value` to indicate sample groups.  
> - **Metabolomics Workbench** embeds multiple group labels in the `Class` column, separated by `|`.  
>  
> In `project_details_file.json`, we parse these into a clean `groupings` object so you can switch between different patient stratifications (e.g., control vs. case, male vs. female, treated vs. untreated).

### 3. Plots

All plots you generate will be saved under the matching subfolders in `/Dummy_project/Plots/` using the filename you provide at export. **Exception**: network plots (both metabolite and pathway networks) are automatically downloaded to your computer’s default Downloads folder. After running your multi-study analysis, please move those network plot files into the appropriate `/Dummy_project/Plots/Multi-study-analysis/…` folders to keep everything organized.

> **Note:** Each subfolder already contains a few example plots generated by the app, so you can see the typical output format and file naming conventions before you start.

---

> 🚀 **Quick Start**  
> After you’ve browsed the folders and seen the example outputs above, you’re all set—just open the app, select **Dummy Project** in the project selection dropdown (in the Single-Study or Multi-Study tab), and start exploring immediately!
